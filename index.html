||  Hi, I'm Sourfruit                                                               ||
||                                                                                  ||
||   I'm lots of things. Software dev by day, hacker by night. Sometimes twisted.   ||
||   A New Yorker. If you'd like to contact me for some reason, (I'm open to it)    ||
||   you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hello@def-not-hacking-the.net?Subject=Hi%20Sourfruit!" target="_top">hello@def-not-hacking-the.net</a>.                             ||
||   I mainly do software development and security research. Anything about those   ||
||   can be found on my twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/s0urfruit">@s0urfruit</a>.                                         ||
||   I also keep most projects private (as in code, especially AI), but usually     ||
||   talk about it openly and deeply in chats so hit me up if you want!             ||
||   Oh, did I mention I'm an AI researcher? Almost everything I use daily          ||
||   usually has AI. From "GPT-3.1" (my own version of GPT-3, Open-AI has no        ||
||   association with it, all mine! You can email for early access too ;)           ||
||   My own GPT-3.1 is probably my favourite project. I hope it powers more         ||
||   things soon, with the early access program I'm doing, such as a code writer    ||
||   Give it what you want in text, and in either: Python, Ruby, C/C++/C#, or Web   ||
||   it creates it! Goal is to make it write code as good as a human, faster        ||
||   Enough of GPT-3.1, lol. A little more about myself: (Again I know right)       ||
||   I live in New York City. I know a whole assortment of programming languages    ||
||   Such as (in order of best knowledge) Python, C#, Ruby, C++, Javascript,        ||
||   Web (HTML, CSS), C, PHP, < the last 4 I know the same as Ruby, just I'm        ||
||   listing them :D. I've also hacked a sh*t ton of things. WhatsApp is just       ||
||   one of them. As well as, briefly, gained access to the Federal Bureau of       ||
||   Investigation's NAS and ~3 computers at their NYC office. They showed up later ||
||   haha. <a href="twitter.com/samykamkar">Samy is my hero!</a> Samy, if you read this;                                 ||
||   You're fucking awesome and I wish to meet you. His site: https://samy.pl       ||
||   I also own https://sourfruit.design for sh*ts and giggles. Its code can be     ||
||   found here: https://github.com/testforsour/testforsour.github.io (its a BSOD)  ||
||                                                                                  ||
||   Well, anyways, thanks for visiting my site. This site will continue to be      ||
||   updated.                                                                       ||
